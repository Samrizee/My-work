        <h1>Girl</h1>
        <p>A girl, a wonder to behold, <br>
        With eyes like stars and heart of gold.<br>
        Her smile, a ray of sunshine bright,<br>
        Her laughter, music in the night.<br><br>
        
        She's strong and brave, yet soft and kind,<br>
        A spirit free, a soaring mind.<br>
        She dances to her own sweet beat,<br>
        And follows dreams with eager feet.<br><br>
        
        Oh, girl, you're truly one of a kind,<br>
        A treasure rare, a precious find.<br>
        May your light shine forever bright,<br>
        And your future be filled with delight.</p>
    </body>
